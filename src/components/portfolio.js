                <p>COVID-19 has required us to plant ourselves in one place, but where do we put our emotions -- the feelings we don’t know what to do with?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        How do we feel, how do we express, and how do we connect in isolation?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Look around. See what others are feeling. You don’t need to do anything.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        If you want to do something, you can share what you are creating to make sense of this.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Connectedness creates resilience.

                <h2>Brand Strategy, Creative Direction</h2>
                <h1>UKAI Projects</h1>
                <p>Ukai is a Japanese cormorant fishing practice. It happens at night, and the fish are drawn to the surface by a fire suspended over the boat. Cormorants have metal rings around their neck tied to strings that the fishermen hold. The cormorants catch fish but can't swallow them. When their throat is full, they are pulled into the boat, and the fish are dumped into a bucket. The fish are shared with the village, and the birds are allowed to swim and eat without the ring at the end of the evening. It's beautiful, sustainable and incredibly inefficient. There is also some uncertainty about how we're meant to think about the birds. They are treated as pets, but it's a strange thing to watch.</p> 
                <p> UKAI Projects responds to the increasingly narrow set of priorities around efficiency and scale in today's culture. Named after the cormorant fishing practice, UKAI Projects exists to research and model new approaches to cultural production. The direction for UKAI is to embrace the complexity of how cultures change and evolve over time, the discomfort of the process, and the beauty of questioning industrial efficiency in response to the precarity prevalent in cultural production work. In collaboration with artist-designer Nour Bishouty, branding UKAI Projects is a process of intentional discomfort, working with limitations, and the discovery of rules to be rewritten. </p>
                <p>Questioning whether one final logo was a rule we have to follow at all, we arrived at not 1 but 100 distinct creations produced by Nour from writing while restricting her bodily movements in 100 different ways.</p>

                <h1>Milieu</h1>
                <p>Milieu is a social and data driven software application that democratizes city planning and development. Milieu expands opportunities for public engagement, and fosters urban transformation that will help tackle the challenges that cities face by producing better urban and architectural products.</p>
                <p>Can these spaces be more than something we see and pass daily? Is there a way that people can contribute to the development and planning process and consequently, the design and construction of the city tomorrow? The challenge is to create new ICT platforms for open data, and to connect and enable public participation in urban development and planning. This involves creating conditions of transparency, predictability, and accountability by deploying tools that inform, engage, and empower people to be part of the conversation.</p>
                <p>As Part of the Guelph Civic Accelerator, Milieu.io worked with public-sector planners to co-develop an engagement platform to better understand residents.</p>

                <h1>Percy Station</h1>
                <p>In 2016, the City of Ottawa announced an open call for “Streetside Spots”. Among other selected proposals, Percy Station was built to bring cultural programs and micro-businesses back to its site - a local cafe and music venue destroyed in a fire Winter 2015. The construction was sponsored by the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Chinatown BIA. The residents in the surrounding areas also donated plants, fixtures, and cash to keep Percy Station running for the duration of the “Streetside Spots” program - June to October 2016. The program includes a kiosk run by local businesses on a rotational basis, a social area surrounded by edible plants, and a bike repair tool-stand maintained by volunteers.</p>

                <h1>Does Architecture Dream of Upheavals?</h1>
                <p>In the search for a speculative architecture to break free from linear evolution, a thoughtful investigation in regards to social, political and economic factors must be conducted. These factors participate within the rhizome, re-appropriating not only on a map, but through a network that suggests an alternative set of parameters influencing architecture and urbanism. This rhizome does not offer a solution to existing architectural difficulties, rather it aims to generate a radical uplift of possibilities: an upheaval, in this senses an architectural performance.</p>
